# final_project_main.py is the only code need to be compiled and run.

# It uses inputs from the folder 'input_videos'. There are six used as the training data, and one (named as 'test_video.mp4') as the test video.

# Do not modify video names. If you need to run with additional test video, name it as 'test_video.mp4' and replace the existing one.

# Once you run the program, all outputs will be write to folder 'output'.
